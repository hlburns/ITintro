#~~~~~~~~~~~Useful Slurm commands~~~~~~~~~~~~#
# For Slurm HPC job scheduler 
~~Starting notes:~~
1) job scripts need to be executable
2) any useful stuff please add

____The Basics___
sbatch jobscript [submit your job right now 
                  to default queue.]
sinfo [tells you what nodes are up, queues 
       available etc. Warning not always 
       truthful - check bright cluster management]
squeue [shows queue]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
____Submission____
sbatch --begin=NOW+4hours jobscript
[submit this in at a certain time e.g.
 if the system is quiet at night and you
 are feeling nice]
sbatch --dependency=afterok:JOBID
[for iterative jobs, once the job has
 successfully ran then run the next one
 - this is annoying to fill the queue with 
 these]
