NOTES on netcdf

useful commands

ncdump: -h runs like ncdisp on matlab, -k gives type of file
ncview: gui have a play with this!
ferret: coming with python - ncviewer and basic programming 
ncks: a great ncdf manipulator

MATLAB: MEGA useful scripts!! /noc/users/hb1g13/PhD/MITgcm/MITgcm/utils/matlab


 
NB current set up is netcdf 3 i.e. classic file type. Netcdf 4 will compress files but will require changing netcdf library and change calls to netcdf 4
