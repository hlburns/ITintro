Frist step = stiching!

Attempted to use the package matlab scripts - they dont work and they're crap

Have chose to use the python script found in:
/noc/users/hb1g13/PhD/MITgcm/MITgcm/utils/python/MITgcmutils/scripts/gluemncbig/

For now I'm Sotring data in /sata/hb1g13/MITgcm/nchannel

cd /noc/altix/scratch/hb1g13/MITgcm/nchannel from the outside!
simply run the script:
gluemncbig -o 15-20all.nc 15-20yr.mnc/mnc_*/state*.nc

ncview it to check - looking good

Next step some simple automated checks
