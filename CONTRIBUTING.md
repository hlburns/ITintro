# Contribution Guidelines #

This used to be a repository of information specifically for the NOCS systems. I have now opened this up to be used a general hub of knowledge and useful tips for computing for scientists.

Contributions are welcome in the form of additions or updates to the wiki or gh-page or to the code repository.

Feel free to contact me if you wish to become involved with this.
