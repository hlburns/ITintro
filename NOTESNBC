Note on changing the northern BC

This is done by changing the diffusivity profile at the norhtern boundary

Channel domains: 4000km x 2000km x 4000m 5km res 24 layers
250 yr spin up
20 year output

nchannel2 = original profile
nchannel3 =
etc etc

change input folder
gendata_so_helen.m 

set up dirs on iri4 nchannel1,2,3 etc
ln to build
mtidy
get pickups
all data files in eedata!
inputs - for different diffusivity profiles
ln to pbs
SPIN UP 250 years
KEEP 20 years
