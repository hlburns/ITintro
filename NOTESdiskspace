Notes on disk space

Each 5yrs of mnc output file = 7GB
75% .nc files 25% STDOUT files (could reduce STDOUT dumps)
Spin up files can be reduced to just restart files to save space

NB df -k does not show gpfs but nocdf will show all the gpfs  

size of file: du -C -sh filename

IRIDIS4
/home = 100GB
/scratch is like fiber with 1TB of space

On iridis4: mmlsquota acts like nocdf
