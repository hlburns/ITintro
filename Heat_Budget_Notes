In order to check the heat budget you need to compare the cumulative (or mean*avaraging interval)
heatflux into the ocean to the change in heat content over the averaging interval. 
In order to get these diagnostics, you need to save (in data.diagnostics)
oceQnet (surface heat flux), or TFLUX (which contains everything) with a "frequency" of e.g. 1year 
to get yearly averages, then THETA with the same negative frequency (-1year) and a "timePhase" of 0 to get snapshots at the beginning and the end of the this interval.

Advective and diffusive fluxes:
ADVx_TH is the 'effect of advection'.  It includes flux-limiting
and diffusion from the numerical scheme.

DFxE_TH
which could be termed "diffusive", i.e. it contains all
non-advective components in the dT/dt sum, such as diffusion due to
Laplacian or biharmonic diffusion (diffKh, diffK4) and due to GM/Redi.

(ADVx_TH, DFxE_TH) are mass-weighted as well
(yes, it's the mass of water in the grid cell),
so you don't have to worry about cell area, thickness or surface  
corrections when computing sums or budgets.

NB:
For closing budgets, or for diagnosing the full effect of the  
advection operator (which is, when flux-limiting, partly 'diffusive'  
in nature) use ADVx_TH.  You will not, for example, be able to easily  
account for all the terms leading to dT/dt at a given gridcell unless  
you use ADVx_TH.
