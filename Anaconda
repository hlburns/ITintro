# The default python is old and very basic
# It's reccomended you use anaconda for more serious computing!
# This is a really neat package, it comes with most of the modules you'll want
# And it comes with conda and pip to install further packages
# This is really usefull as we have no root passwords!

#~~installing:~~#
# Go to http://continuum.io/downloads
# download the Linux 64-bit version and move the file to your unix space
# Anaconda 2.0 + works best on the new system as they changed the default 
# Backends to work better with what ever nocs has!
# Type
chmod 755 Anaconda-2.0.1-Linux-x86.sh
bash Anaconda-2.0.1-Linux-x86.sh
# to install (in csh you may need to type ./Anaconda-2.0.1-Linux-x86.sh)
# Follow the instructions - this is around 4GB so you may want to store it
# Outside of your home directory (I leave mine in my home directory)
# Onces it's install it'll add a line to you .bashrc as it assumes you are 
# sensible and in bash - most likely you're not so you have to add the 
# following to your .cshrc:
setenv PYTHONPATH "/noc/users/$USER/anaconda/bin"
setenv PATH "/noc/users/$USER/anaconda/bin:${PATH}"
# You'll have to change the path if you not put it in your home dir!
# Check 
which ipython
# It should now point to your anaconda GREAT!

#~~Installing packages ~~#
# Keeping up-to-date:
conda update conda
conda update anaconda
# You'll most likely need to intstall the netcdf4 package:
conda install netcdf4
# Personally I use the scipy.io netcdf module so leave out the large netcdf4
# module


#Finally if you want a nice GUI interface:
# Ananconder comes with 
spyder
# And you can set up the Ipython notebook (see separe txt file!)
# Which also tells you how to link kernals so you can type comands in 
# the QTconsol on your computer and run it on a NOCS machine.
# I just use the notebook but info for linking kernels is here.
# It takes a bit of fiddling so give yourself a day before you go away
# to figure it out if your using this to speed up working from home 
# with a dodgy internet connection.
