# IT Notes #

Useful notes on all things tech related

## Overview ##

Previously I hosted a wiki and repository for Scientific Computing on the NOC UNIX systems. This has been a useful resource that many people have used as well a serving as a useful reference for myself! I will continue to maintain this repository of useful information but no longer geared for the NOC systems.

## Usage ##
