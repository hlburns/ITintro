Here are a few text files to help people set up various stuff on the systems
here.
I've tried to make things idiot proof! 

If you are completely new first read the example files
.cshrc
.login 
these provide a quick set up on the systems to get you going

The rest of the stuff is for Python, Bash and verison control
