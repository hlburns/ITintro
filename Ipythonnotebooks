# This are really cool and really useful!

#~~What is it?~~#
# There a load of useful tutorials online
http://nbviewer.ipython.org/
# Basically write your python script as if it were a notebook through a web 
# browser. You can type in directly latex and html code to put pictures
# and equations in. 
# I will convert itself into a python script or .tex file for you!
# It's really great to share stuff with people that aren't that familiar with
# python - simply upload your notebook to the nbviewer and share it!

# Launching a local notebook is as simple as:
ipython notebook 
# you might want to add 
c.IPKernelApp.pylab = 'inline' 
# to ~/.ipython/profile_default/ipython_notebook_config.py
# this will allow plots to show on the screen
 http://localhost:8888/
# I prefer to set up up to run remotely as its much faster!

#~~Setting up~~#
# Please use the anaconda setup using setup command or if on your own 
# machine read the Anaconda file in this repository 
# http://ipython.org/ipython-doc/rel-1.1.0/interactive/public_server.html
# The steps above don't quite work on the NOCS systems but probably will 
# on your own computer.
# open ipython through the terminal
ipython
from IPython.lib import passwd
passwd()
# It will ask you for a password - the nocs system has trouble with symbols
# Just number and letters and it will work fine!
# It will output a key
# Copy this key
# Ctrl+Z  will suspend this process and take you back to the terminal 
# Create a profile for a computer e.g. theia
ipython profile create nbtheia
cd ~/.ipython/profile_nbtheia
# now edit the ipython_notebook_config.py
# add or uncomment the following lines:
c = get_config()

# Kernel config
c.IPKernelApp.pylab = 'inline'  # if you want plotting support always

# Notebook config
c.NotebookApp.ip = '139.166.240.35' or 'theia.noc.soton.ac.uk 
# Find from ifconfig command of hostname.noc.soton.ac.uk (must specify)
c.NotebookApp.open_browser = False # If true will launch Firefox through 
                                   # X server (slow!)
c.NotebookApp.password = u'[Paste your key here]'
# It is a good idea to put it on a known, fixed port
c.NotebookApp.port = 9999

# If that key is no longer in your clipboard type:
fg
# to resume the ipython session and recopy it
# else just exit the session now.
# Create a directory in your home dir for your notebooks e.g.
mkdir notebooks
cd notebooks
# now lets start the server:
screen -S nbserver
ipython notebook --profile=nbtheia
# This will start a screen session and launch the server
# On your own web browser go to 
http://139.166.240.187:9999/ (The IP address and port number)
of 
theia.noc.soton.ac.uk:9999
# type in your password and start a new notebook.
# Mine are mostly readable to all so take a look for examples in
# ~hb1g13/Python/notebooks
# Now detach the screen so you can close the terminal window
# Ctrl+A+D - will detach the screen so you can exit while the process 
# still runs
# If you want to reattach the screen 
screen -r nbserver
# I'm super lazy so I've set up aliases in my .cshrc 
# nbtheia etc to start the server and then I've bookmarked the IP addresses.
# NB!!!! From outside the uni network you must VPN!

#~~Converting .ipynb to .py or .tex~~#
# Go to your folder with your notebook files
# to make a python script simply type
ipython nbconvert --to python notebook.ipynb
# to make a latex document
ipython nbconvert --to latex notebook.ipynb
# You will need to add ~hb1g13/bin/pandoc to your path 
# Either copy it over or just add ~hb1g13/bin/ to your path in your
# .cshrc
setenv PATH "${PATH}:/noc/users/hb1g13/bin"
# I store a lot of stuff in there so it is probably best to have your own
# ~/bin dir and copy over the file and simply add instead
setenv PATH "${PATH}:/noc/users/$USER/bin"
# If you get an error email me with the error as there maybe a missing library
# file you need. H.Burns@noc.soton.ac.uk
