#~~Git on the NOCS systems~~#

##~~Instalation~~##

Noc has git but an old version (this can cause problems)
Please use version 1.8 or later - i use 2.1

NB these commands were done is bash shell 
   please see bash file of swaping shells
   or see csh version below.

NB If you get a weird error first port of call
   would be to try a different machine, themis
   and tethys work fine

NB The system has a git-scm under the setup command
   I can't find a away to get this run smoothly with
   out ssh keys etc. If anyone finds a way please put
   it here!

Download the source code from github Git.2.10 etc
Extract it and move it over to your home directory
Simply cd into Git.2.10 directory and run:
make && make install 
This creates your git commands right here!
My set up is move this to
~/bin/gitfolder
and simply add:
export PATH=/home/user/bin/git/:$PATH 
to .bashrc
source ./.bashrc  to update and check 
git --version 

**Csh install:
Same as bash (if make && make install don't work try ./make )
My set up is move this to
~/bin/gitfolder
and simply add:
setenv PATH "/home/user/bin/git/:$PATH"
to .cshrc
source ./.cshrc  to update and check
git --version

#~~Setting up git:~~#

sign up online
(use your username and password chosen)
git config --global user.name "your-name"
git config --global user.email "your-email"

cd to directory and type
git init
git status
-If you use emacs i would remove the buffers here!
git add . #Adds all files to repo
git commit -a -m "first commit"
#First create a new repo online and get the url
git remote add origin https://github.com/username/repo.git
git push -u origin master # Adds to master branch

# If you get an error here please try 
git config http.sslVerify "false"
# and repeat - Some computers are slightly differenct and you just can't 
# get the openssl to verify stuff
# Still having trouble - you may need to update open SSL please see the file
# OpenSSL
# Note there is libcurl library problem on theia, please use another machine
# This has been tested on themis
