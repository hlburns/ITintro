#~~~~~ Mounting remote file systems~~~~~#
----------------------------------------
# This allows you to access the Unix file system 
# directly from your computer
----------------------------------------
__Instalation___
~~~ Ubuntu:~~~
sudo apt-get install sshfs
~~~ Mac:~~~
#       https://osxfuse.github.io/ 
#       Install SSHFS and OSXFuse
~~~Older Mac systems:~~~~
#  Google and install homebrew
#  (you made need the gcc compiler and developer tools)
#      in a terminal simply type:
brew install sshfs
# Homebrew is cool it works similar to Linux apt-get, 
# yum commands etc so you can install things like emacs
# and inkscape too.
# Windows: I believe this is still possible, 
           but running a Virtual Machine 
           (IT will support this!) it's probably the 
           easiest option and running Linux!
-----------------------------------------
___Application___
#Mac/Linux:
#Create a folder in your home directory
mkdir NOC
#Add the following to your .bashrc
alias mountnoc='sshfs $USER@ssh.noc.soton.ac.uk:/ NOC' 
**$USER** is your nocs username
# You can set whatever machine you like, and you can set it to your home directory 
# here it's just set the the top directory and I've set a load of aliases such as
# home and scratch to navigate through quickly.
# -o sets ssfs to follow symbolic links - if you set to the top directory then 
# you don't really need this option!
** Recomendation mount top directory and set symbolic link to home dir**
# Any trouble with it you can unmount it:
sudo umount NOC
# Still miss behaving simply:
sudo umount NOC
rm -rf NOC
mkdir NOC
mountnoc
# Removing the mountpoint won't try and delete the file system itself 
# NB removing files within the mountpoint does delete the files!

# NB:
#If you use this command outside of NOCS you'll need to be on vpn:
sshfs -o username@tethys.noc.soton.ac.uk:/ NOC
#if you don't want to use VPN just change to
sshfs -o username@charon.noc.soton.ac.uk:/ NOC
