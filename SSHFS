# Mounting remote file systems
# This allows you to access the Unix filesystem direction from your computer

# Unbuntu: sudo apt-get install sshfs
# Mac: google and install homebrew (you made need the gcc compiler and developer tools)
#      in a terminal simple brew install sshfs
#      Homebrew is cool it works similar to linux apt-get, yum comands etc so you can install 
#      things like emacs and inkscape too.
# Windows: I believe this is still possible, but running a Virtual Machine (IT will support this!)
           is probably the easiest option and running linux!
#Mac/Linux:
#Creat a folder in your home directory
mkdir NOC
#Add the following to your .bashrc
alias mountnoc='sshfs -o username@tethys.noc.soton.ac.uk:/ NOC' 
# You can set whatever machine you like, and you can set it to your home directory 
# here it's just set the the top directory and i've set a load of aliases such as
# home and scratch to navigate through quickly.
# The -o sets ssfs to follow symbolic links - if you set to the top directory then 
# you don't really need this option!
# Any trouble with it you can unmount it:
sudo umount NOC
# Still miss behaving simply:
sudo umount NOC
rm -rf NOC
mkdir NOC
mountnoc
# Removing the mountpoint won't try and delete the filesystem itself 
# NB removing files within the mountpoint does delete the files!
